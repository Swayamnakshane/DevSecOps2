# 🔐 DevSecOps2: Secure CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

A practical end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline integrating CI/CD with security tooling at every stage—scanning code, containers, infrastructure, secrets, and runtime using open-source tools.

---

## 📦 Overview

This project implements a **DevSecOps pipeline** to ensure secure delivery of cloud-native applications using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and various security tools.

It demonstrates the **Shift-Left Security** philosophy by embedding security checks from the earliest stages of development and automating them through the CI/CD process.

---

## 🔧 Pipeline Stages & Tooling

### 1. 🛠️ CI/CD Setup (Jenkins)
- Automate builds on every `push` or PR via Jenkins.
- Pipeline Steps:
  - Checkout Code from GitHub
  - Docker Build
  - Run SAST, SCA, IaC, Secrets Scan
  - Run DAST against staging
  - Deploy (if all tests pass)

### 2. 🔍 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Tool**: [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or SonarCloud
- Purpose: Analyze source code for vulnerabilities, code smells, and bugs.
- Enforce quality gates: Block pipeline on critical/high vulnerabilities.

### 3. 🧬 Software Composition Analysis (SCA) & Image Scanning
- **Tool**: [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), Grype (optional)
- Scans:
  - Base images for CVEs
  - Application dependencies
  - Configuration issues and secrets

### 4. 🌐 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- **Tool**: [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/)
- Test staging environments for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi).
- Schedule before production releases.

### 5. 🔑 Secrets Detection & Management
- **Tool**: `detect-secrets`, `git-secrets`, `TruffleHog`
- CI stage to detect hardcoded credentials and tokens.
- **Secrets Storage**: Use Jenkins credentials store or a vault like:
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - HashiCorp Vault

### 6. 🏗 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
- **Tool**: [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov), Terrascan, KICS, Kubescape
- Scan Terraform/Kubernetes/CloudFormation files.
- Prevent misconfigured or insecure deployments.

### 7. 🧠 Shift-Left Security & Threat Modelling
- **Tool**: OWASP Threat Dragon, Threagile, PyTM
- Perform early threat modeling during design phase.
- Document mitigation strategies and review in retrospectives.

### 8. 🔍 Continuous Monitoring / Runtime Security
- **Tool**: [Falco](https://falco.org/), Anchore ThreatMapper, Steampipe
- Monitor container runtime behavior for anomalies and CVEs.
- Log analysis and alerting after deployment.

### 9. 📜 Compliance & Policy as Code
- **Tool**: [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), Gatekeeper
- Define security policies (e.g., no privileged pods, encrypted S3 buckets).
- Auto-audit for standards like **PCI-DSS**, **ISO 27001**, **GDPR**.

### 10. 🔁 Feedback Loops & Security Culture
- Notify developers via GitHub PR comments or Slack.
- Promote Security Champions inside teams.
- Conduct continuous secure coding training.

## 📋 Jenkins Pipeline Flow (Simplified)

| Stage             | Tool(s)                   | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Checkout & Build | GitHub → Docker/Gradle    | Build containerized app/image                           |
| SAST             | SonarQube/SonarCloud      | Static code analysis & vulnerability detection          |
| SCA & Image Scan | Trivy / Grype             | Check dependencies and container image vulnerabilities  |
| IaC Scan         | Checkov / Terrascan       | Scan infrastructure code for misconfigurations          |
| DAST             | OWASP ZAP (baseline scan) | Dynamic testing on staging deployment                   |
| Secrets Scan     | detect-secrets / git-secrets | Prevent accidental leakage of secrets                |
| Deploy           | Kubernetes / Docker Swarm | Deploy on staging/production if all checks pass         |
| Runtime Security | Falco / ThreatMapper      | Monitor deployed environment for runtime issues         |
| Compliance Audit | Policy-as-code tools      | Verify adherence to compliance policies                 |
| Notification     | Slack / Email             | Alert team on failures, remediation actions             |

## 🛠 Tooling Ecosystem

This project uses proven open-source security tools including:

- SAST: **SonarQube**, **Semgrep**
- SCA/Image: **Trivy**, **Grype**
- IaC: **Checkov**, **Terrascan**, **KICS**
- DAST: **OWASP ZAP**
- Secrets Detection: **git-secrets**, **TruffleHog**
- Runtime: **Falco**, **Anchore ThreatMapper**
- Compliance: **OPA**, **Steampipe**

---

## ✅ Why This Pipeline Works

- **Shift‑Left**: Security checks integrated early in development.
- **Automated Feedback**: CI feedback on every commit helps developers fix issues quickly.
- **Full Security Coverage**: Static + Dynamic + IaC + Runtime + Compliance.
- **Repeatable & Scalable**: Automates security as code across environments.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detects and alerts on suspicious runtime activity.
